In 1990, archaeologists working on a monastic site in Dunheim, Germany dug out several human skulls. However, they weren't analyzing cranial measurements: they were looking at teeth covered by dental calculus – a cover on the dental surface caused by periodontitis. Since periodontitis is the second most common dental disease worldwide, you may think they wanted to prove that our ancestors suffered from the same dental disease as 750 million people today. However, they were actually interested in the time capsules that dental calculus provides: they can preserve DNA for 1000s of years!<br>
We can refer to these samples as “Microbial Pompeii”. Like the citizens of the ancient city that was buried by ash, this microbial community was buried by layers of dental calculus and was kept intact for more than 1000 years. Scientists extracted DNA from the material underneath the dental calculus.<br>
In this project, we will explore these samples and study the history of oral diseases in humans.<br>
